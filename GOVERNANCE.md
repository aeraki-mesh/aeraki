## Values

The Aeraki Mesh and its leadership embrace the following values:

* Openness: Communication and decision-making happens in the open and is discoverable for future
  reference. As much as possible, all discussions and work take place in public
  forums and open repositories.

* Fairness: All stakeholders have the opportunity to provide feedback and submit
  contributions, which will be considered on their merits.

* Community over Product or Company: Sustaining and growing our community takes
  priority over shipping code or sponsors' organizational goals.  Each
  contributor participates in the project as an individual.

* Inclusivity: We innovate through different perspectives and skill sets, which
  can only be accomplished in a welcoming and respectful environment.

* Participation: Responsibilities within the project are earned through
  participation, and there is a clear path up the contributor ladder into leadership
  positions.

## Steering Committee

The steering committee is a governing body that makes directional and strategic decisions for 
the Aeraki Mesh project. It will also decide on any changes on its governance, marketing and 
future direction. Seats will be tied to organizations and not individuals and will be valid for 
1 year from the start date.

Steering seats will be evaluated once per year and new people/organizations can be nominated
for being added to the steering committee based on contribution to the project or being a
valuable end user. The existing steering committee will decide on any changes to the steering 
committee based on what is best for the project and community.

Organizations can also be removed from the steering committee due to lack of project commitment
on the same yearly basis. This will be determined by a majority vote of the existing committee.
The exception to this is the Aeraki Mesh founder seat which is a permanent seat.

## Maintainers

Aeraki Mesh Maintainers have write access to the corresponding project GitHub repository.
They can merge their own patches or patches from others. The current maintainers
can be found in [MAINTAINERS](./MAINTAINERS.md).  Maintainers collectively manage the project's
resources and contributors.

This privilege is granted with some expectation of responsibility: maintainers
are people who care about the Aeraki Mesh project and want to help it grow and
improve. A maintainer is not just someone who can make changes, but someone who
has demonstrated their ability to collaborate with the team, get the most
knowledgeable people to review code and docs, contribute high-quality code, and
follow through to fix issues (in code or tests).

A maintainer is a contributor to the project's success and a citizen helping
the project succeed.

## Becoming a Maintainer

To become a Maintainer you need to demonstrate the following:

  * commitment to the project
    * participate in discussions, contributions, code reviews for 3 months or more,
    * contribute 5 non-trivial pull requests and have them merged into the `master` branch,
  * ability to write good code,
  * ability to collaborate with the team,
  * understanding of how the team works (policies, processes for testing and code review, etc),
  * understanding of the projects' code base and coding style.


A new Maintainer must be proposed by an existing maintainer by sending a message to the
[developer mailing list](TODO: List Link). A simple majority vote of existing Maintainers
approves the application.

Maintainers who are selected will be granted the necessary GitHub rights,
and invited to the [private maintainer mailing list](TODO).

## Maintainer duties

Maintainers are required to participate in the project, by joining discussions, submitting and reviewing pull requests, answering user questions, among others.

Maintainers are also encouraged to speak about Aeraki Mesh at conferences, especially KubeCon+CloudNativeCon+IstioCon.

## Changes in Maintainership

We do not expect anyone to make a permanent commitment to be a Aeraki Mesh maintainer forever. After all, circumstances change,
people get new jobs, new interests, and may not be able to continue contributing to the project. At the same time, we need
to keep the list of maintainers current in order to have effective governance. People may be removed from the current list
of maintainers via one of the following ways:
  * They can resign
  * If they stop contributing to the project for a period of 6 months or more
  * By a 2/3 majority vote by maintainers

Former maintainers can be reinstated to full maintainer status through the same process of
[Becoming a Maintainer](#becoming-a-maintainer) as first-time nominees.

## Emeritus Maintainers

Former maintainers are recognized with an honorary _Emeritus Maintainer_ status, and have their names permanently
listed in the README as a form of gratitude for their contributions.

## Changes in Governance

All changes in Governance require a 2/3 majority vote by maintainers.

## Other Changes

Unless specified above, all other changes to the project require a 2/3 majority vote by maintainers.
Additionally, any maintainer may request that any change require a 2/3 majority vote by maintainers.
